# To run
<ul>
<li>Extract results.zip (result files are too large for GitHub uncompressed)</li>
<li>Install npm with sudo apt install npm</li>
<li>Install dependencies with npm install -y</li>
<li>Provide enough memory for large files with export NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=5120</li>
<li>Start your local server with npm start</li>
</ul>

# To analyze your own results
<ul>
<li>Download Wireshark, run a scan, and export packet dissections as JSON</li>
<li>Either change what one of the {group member}.js files import for data to yours, or use a {group member}.js file as a template and modify App.js to create a page for your results</li>
</ul>

# File explanation  
The vast majority of these files were autogenerated by create-react-app  
The files we added are {group member}.js and {group member}Results.json
